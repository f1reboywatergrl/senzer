This is a simple Sentiment Analyzer app that analyzes Indonesian tweets using tweepy. The app lets you input a keyword, and it allows you to update your data to CSV and a SQL Database, update its sentiment score (using comparison to positive/negative words as metrics), view data from an inputtable period of time (e.g. 2020-09-09 to 2020-09-11), and visualize data from an inputtable period of time.
